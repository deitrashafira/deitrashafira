# Hi everyone! :smiley: 

My name is **Deitra Afilia Shafira**, call me Deitra for short.  
I am a final year Brawijaya University student pursuing in Statistics Bachelor's, envisioning to be a top-tier data scientist which is aligned with my machine learning and deep learning skills. It's proven by the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.credential.net/29133dc6-9841-4051-b22b-f36b9e5c82fa#gs.82hnxj) I've acquired on July 30, 2022.  
I love dealing with the compound of a wide range of data and IT involvements, and hence I do create some individual projects that will be posted on this GitHub account for my potential growth.  
If you're interested to get knowing me more, let's connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deitrashafira/)! :smile_cat:
