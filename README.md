# Hi everyone! :smiley: 

My name is **Deitra Afilia Shafira**, call me Deitra for short.
I am a final year Brawijaya University student pursuing in Statistics Bachelor's, envisioning to be a top-tier data scientist which is aligned with my machine learning and deep learning skills. It's proven by the TensorFlow Developer Certificate I've acquired on July 29, 2022.
I love dealing with the compound of a wide range of data and IT involvements, and hence I am currently looking for an internship role related to the world of data as a place for my potential growth.
If you're interested to get knowing me more, let's connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deitrashafira/)! :smile_cat:
